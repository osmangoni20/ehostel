After sipping the hot tea, I do jogging for half an hour on the terrace of my house, along with my elder brother. After the jogging I brush my teeth and get ready for my study which continues undisturbed up to my breakfast."

        content:"Every morning I get up around 5.00 a.m. Wash myself, brush my teeth and do my yoga exercises for forty five minutes. Then I take my bath and have breakfast. I study for an hour and by 9.15 a.m. I am ready for school. I walk to school. When I return home I wash myself again, get into home clothes, eat something and go off to my private tutor's house. I study there for about two hours and return home. We have dinner around 9 p.m. and by ten I am in bed. Before falling off asleep, I pull up a story book and read. On Sundays and other holidays, I have to study only for two hours in the morning. The rest of the day I am free to read my story books, draw, dance and listen to music. Sometimes my parents take me out."
